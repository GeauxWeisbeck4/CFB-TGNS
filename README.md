## College Football Tailgating n Stay App

Air BnB meets college football gameday in this app that helps you research and book your place to stay when you hit the road to see your favorite team take on their rival. Rent out your backyard for tailgaters, rent a room for fans who need a place to crash, and represent your team by getting good ratings as a visitor or host! 

This is the very beginning of the project.
